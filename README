feh - Imlib2 based image viewer

 * <https://derf.homelinux.org/p/feh/>
 * <http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/>


Dependencies:

 * giblib
 * Imlib2
 * libpng
 * libX11


Recommended:

 * jpegtran  (supplied by the jpeg library, for lossless image rotation)
 * wget      (for http/ftp support)


Installation:

$ make
$ sudo make install

If compilation does not work or you want to customize stuff (like disable
Xinerama support), edit config.mk first.

Note: config.mk is designed so that in most cases, you can set environment
variables instead of editing it. E.g.:
CFLAGS='-g -Os' make
export DESTDIR=/tmp/feh PREFIX=/usr; make && make install


Testing (non-X):

$ make test

Requires perl >= 5.10 with Test::Command. The tests are non-interactive and
work without X, so they can safely be run even on a headless buildserver.


Testing (X):

Requires
 * perl >= 5.10
 * Test::More
 * X11::GUITest
 * Xnest

$ make test-x11

Be aware that this is quite experimental, so far the X-tests have only been
run on one machine. So they may or may not work for you.
