Compile:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

(Red hat users, use $ ./configure --prefix=/usr)

Run the test scripts in the src directory to see it in action.

### Note ###

If your imlib2 / your system uses libjpeg 6.2, use this feh.
If they are built against libjpeg8, use feh from the 'jpeg8' branch
(which currently does not work, but will hopefully be fixed soonish)


What is feh?
