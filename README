Compile:

$ make
$ sudo make install

If compilation does not work or you want to customize stuff (like disable
Xinerama support), edit config.mk first.

Note: config.mk is designed so that in most cases, you can set environment
variables instead of editing it. E.g.:
CFLAGS='-g -Os' make
export DESTDIR=/tmp/feh PREFIX=/usr; make && make install

If you want to run a few non-interactive tests, use "make test". This will
require a standard perl distribution (especially the "prove" script) and the
Test::Command module. If mdocml is installed, it will be used to check the
manual syntax, otherwise that test will be skipped.

What is feh?

Note:
For lossless rotation you will need the "jpegtran" binary supplied by the
jpeg library. In Debian, it's shipped by libjpeg-progs.
