5. various Xinerama issues
--------------------------
From TODO:
On screen 1, it will work if fullscreen is turned off, the window is rendered
and moved so that its top corner is only on screen 1, and then fullscreen is
turned on (after that, it'll work for all images in the slideshow).

9. feh fails for massive images
-------------------------------
At first I thought this was a single-band TIFF image problem but when I
starting playing with resizing things I noticed feh becoming happy.. so I
started twiddling until I was right between the edge of failing and working:

By massive I mean the original image is:  30691x30661

Playing with resizing to various gets me:
23325x23302 fails (76%)
23018x22995  good (75%)

Next phase was to make sure it wasn't just the TIFF libraries.. so converted
the TIFFs to PNG
tifftopnm | pnmtopng >

Same behavior - the 76 fails, 75 works.   Trying one more time this time
converting to JPG for a last sanity check.

Feh blows up with No Imlib2 loader for that file format on the 76 but the 75
works.   Gimp opens both images (in any of the formats) fine (considering the
size of the images).  XV opens all sizes fine.

I can't distribute the raw (source TIFF) imagery (licensing issue) but I can
provide the JPG and PNG files for others to confirm the behavior.

I put the 75 and 76 as PNG and JPG there along with the original as a PNG.

Running feh 1.9-21-gbeecfaf from github on a FC13 x86_64 machine.

12. "Reverse" --scale-down (zoom images to screen size)
-------------------------------------------------------
Requested by mail:

Don't go fullscreen, but do make the window as big as possible (either max out
width or height) and zoom the image in to fit if necessary.
So, it's like --scale-down, but zooming in, not out.

This can already partially be achieved by combining --auto-zoom and --geometry
/ the "Freeze Window Size" menu setting.

24. maybe: include giblib directly into feh
-------------------------------------------
There are only three programs using giblib, one of them is feh. And feh only
uses a part of giblib. So including those parts into the source and removing
the dependency might be an idea

67. receive commands from the terminal that started feh
-------------------------------------------------------
I am running feh on a remote machine by starting it from a ssh terminal. I
expected to be able to use the shortcuts in the terminal  just as I would when
feh is running localy. Feh does output to the terminal (e.g. when a filetype
isn't supported) but it doesn't react to input from the terminal. Apparently I
can use SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to go back and forth between images but it would be
much easier if feh would just react to keyboard input from the terminal.

72. --scale-down: account for window decorations
------------------------------------------------
Reported by mail: Apparently, --scale-down does not take window decorations
into consideration when calculating the maximum
window size. Gotta fix that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
$ feh -tSsize  /path/to/images/

/path/to/images/ ), in order specified by command (-Ssize, sort by size)

what happened:
the image opens in slideshow mode,
press d, that's what it draws:

78. toggle_fullscreen action assigned to mouse button not working
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible to assign keys actions to mouse buttons? Installed newest
source, compiled on Fedora 14, tried toggle_fullscreen 1 in mouse
configuration, disables keyboard v key and no actions for mouse button. Urgent
feature for touchscreen implementations to configure all key actions for 1st
and 3rd mouse buttons.

81. zoom, scale-down etc. are a huge mess
-----------------------------------------
* when using feh --scale-down, the middle button toggles between zoom 100% and
zoom to fit. It should only set zoom to 100%
* --scale-down: removing the zoom = 1.001 workaround from keyevents.c, zoom
100% -> zoom in / out breaks
* same for events.c, except there's no workaround in place

82. feh loads movies with convert
---------------------------------
feh loads movies with convert. That takes a very long time, because I only have
5 gigabytes of RAM. (pun intended) That is probably an unintended "feature"
introduced by commit ba08d4b25fcbcd4e16388673184cf4d179dbd420.

For my needs it would be best if I could disable the call to convert by default
(maybe a new config file?), while providing a command line argument reenabling
the convert feature. (for the rare occasions when I use really obscure file
formats)
