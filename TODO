caching of thumbnails doesn't seem to take thumbnail size into account.
Change sizes and you get the old thumbs....

Option --autograb for feh to grab keyboard - so you can control feh without
having to focus it. Have to be a bit careful with this but could be useful.

key/option/signal/timeout to totally reload filelist (rescan directories etc)

The "No more slides left in show" bug was fixed, but now there's a rare
condition (viewing a few images, removing them externally while viewing,
then resizing the window) causing imlib2 warnings.

<keypad begin> antialieses the image, but doing that automatically upon
key release would be better. However, I couldn't find a way to do that so far.
Even when holding down a key, everytime the eventloop runs I get a
KeyRelease event.

--thumb-title covers a very specific case, would be cool to make this more
general (usable in index mode, as image info in thumbnail mode, etc.)

--reload-button might be useless (wtf is button 0)

Control thumbnail mode (image selection, mainly) with keys.

Xinerama support is present, but far from perfect.
Some day I will debug that, I guess.
