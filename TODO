5. Xinerama only works for Xinerama screen 0
--------------------------------------------
From TODO:
On screen 1, it will work if fullscreen is turned off, the window is rendered
and moved so that its top corner is only on screen 1, and then fullscreen is
turned on (after that, it'll work for all images in the slideshow).

9. feh fails for massive images
-------------------------------
At first I thought this was a single-band TIFF image problem but when I
starting playing with resizing things I noticed feh becoming happy.. so I
started twiddling until I was right between the edge of failing and working:

By massive I mean the original image is:  30691x30661

Playing with resizing to various gets me:
23325x23302 fails (76%)
23018x22995  good (75%)

Next phase was to make sure it wasn't just the TIFF libraries.. so converted
the TIFFs to PNG
tifftopnm | pnmtopng >

Same behavior - the 76 fails, 75 works.   Trying one more time this time
converting to JPG for a last sanity check.

Feh blows up with No Imlib2 loader for that file format on the 76 but the 75
works.   Gimp opens both images (in any of the formats) fine (considering the
size of the images).  XV opens all sizes fine.

I can't distribute the raw (source TIFF) imagery (licensing issue) but I can
provide the JPG and PNG files for others to confirm the behavior.

I put the 75 and 76 as PNG and JPG there along with the original as a PNG.

Running feh 1.9-21-gbeecfaf from github on a FC13 x86_64 machine.

12. "Reverse" --scale-down (zoom images to screen size)
-------------------------------------------------------
Requested by mail:

Don't go fullscreen, but do make the window as big as possible (either max out
width or height) and zoom the image in to fit if necessary.
So, it's like --scale-down, but zooming in, not out.

This can already partially be achieved by combining --auto-zoom and --geometry
/ the "Freeze Window Size" menu setting.

14. Reload functionality for directories
----------------------------------------
--reload works for single images, but not for directories

With the use of feh I built a simple Info-Screen with a mini-pc and a samba
share from which feh loads images and displays them as a slideshow.

Feh is able to reload a file after an amount of time. But it doesn't reload the
content of a folder. I used a script that restarts feh every 10 minutes to make
it display files that are uploaded to the samba share while feh is running.

24. maybe: include giblib directly into feh
-------------------------------------------
There are only three programs using giblib, one of them is feh. And feh only
uses a part of giblib. So including those parts into the source and removing
the dependency might be an idea

25. Configure buttons via config file
-------------------------------------
Right now keys have a config file while buttons use commandline options. Fix
that.

46. --draw-filename: "x of y": wrong y after file deletion
----------------------------------------------------------
After deleting a file, feh will still count it when calculating the total shown
in the next image. This is fixed by any action causing the image window to be
re-rendered.

Like: "1 of 4" -> delete file -> "2 of 4" -> rerender -> "1 of 3"

49. separated short options in theme file
-----------------------------------------
if a theme (but not normal commandline) contains multiple separate short
options (e.g. -x -d instead of -xd), feh gives errors and ignores the first
argument specified on commandline, or segfaults if no arguments are specified.
for example:
theme: feh --scale-down -x -d
commandline: feh ~/img.jpg
result: the following errors, and loading all images in . while ignoring
~/img.jpg
feh: invalid option -- 'ï¿½'
feh: invalid option -- ''
